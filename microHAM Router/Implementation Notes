Parsing Received Data---------------------We follow classical compiler technique by having a lexical scanner followed by a sytaxical parser.Lexical Scanner---------------Data is read one byte at a time from the serial port that is connected to the keyer.  Toavoid blocking the rest of the app, the code for this is contained in a thread -scannerThread: inKeyer.m.The input stream is scanned into four bit long FRAMES.  The first byte of a frame has the FRAME SYNC bit (0x80) of the byte turned off.  The other three bytes have the 0x80 bit turned on.If the FRAME sync bit falls out of sequence (OFF, ON, ON, ON, OFF, ON, ON, ON...), the scanner throws awaycharacters that it has read until synchronization is again received.When four consecutive bytes are received with the proper frame sync pattern (OFF, ON, ON, ON), the sannersubmits that frame to the parser at -receivedFrame: in Router.m.Parser------
